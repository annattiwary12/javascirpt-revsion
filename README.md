📚 Purpose
This repository is meant for revising important JavaScript concepts through practical examples. It helps solidify understanding and serves as a quick reference for interviews or technical discussions.

# JavaScript Concepts Revision

This repository contains a structured revision of core JavaScript concepts through code examples. Each folder/file demonstrates a particular feature or principle in JavaScript. Perfect for brushing up concepts before interviews or projects!

---

## 🔧 Topics Covered

### 1. 📌 `closer/`
Demonstrates **Closures** in JavaScript — the ability of an inner function to remember variables from its outer function scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.

### 2. 🧩 `composition/`
Explores **Function Composition**, a functional programming technique where multiple functions are combined to build complex operations from simpler ones.

### 3. 🌍 `getlocation/`
Uses the **Geolocation API** to get the user's current latitude and longitude. Demonstrates browser-based geolocation and handling permissions/errors.

### 4. 🔁 `iterator/`
Shows how to use **Iterators and Generators** for custom iteration logic in JavaScript. Helpful in understanding how `for...of`, spread, and manual iteration work.

### 5. ⏳ `promisification/`
Covers **Promisification** — converting callback-based functions into Promise-based ones for better asynchronous handling and chaining.

### 6. ⏲️ `timer/`
Demonstrates the use of **Timers** (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and `clearInterval`) to handle delayed or repeated execution.

### 7. 🌦️ `weather-app/`
A mini project that consumes a **Weather API** and uses JavaScript to fetch and display weather data. Includes real-world use of `fetch()`, DOM manipulation, and async/await.

## 🧪 Individual JS Files

### ✅ `first.js`
Contains basic function and variable definitions — used for initial testing or foundational syntax revision.

### ✅ `second.js`
Demonstrates slightly advanced topics like object manipulation, higher-order functions, or conditionals.

### ✅ `fourth.js`
Contains either experimental code or continued logic from previous files — acts as a playground for further exploration.

---

## 🖥️ Frontend Files

### `index.html`
Main HTML structure for testing JavaScript files and projects. Linked with the JS and CSS files.

### `style.css`
Simple CSS file to style the HTML elements — used in conjunction with `index.html` and potentially `weather-app`.
